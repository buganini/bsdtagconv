NOTICE: THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPEMENT ! but it's safe without --notest

Note:
	Conversion string needs to be ended with utf-8,ascii.

Example:
	bsdtagconv 'gbk,ascii:utf-8,ascii;big5,ascii:utf-8,ascii' -i utf-8,ascii:zhtw:zhtw_words:utf-8,ascii blah.mp3
	argv[1] is ';' joined utf-8 ended conversion, for id3v1 decoding.
	bsdtagconv will choose the best result.

Dependencies:
	bsdconv-4.9 (or 4.X && bsdconv.h fix for C++)
	audio/taglib (http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html)

TODO:
	allow setting encoding for id3v1
	migrate from id3v1 to id3v2
