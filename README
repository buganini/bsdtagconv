NOTICE: THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPEMENT ! but it's safe without --notest

Note:
	Conversion string needs to be ended with utf-8,ascii.

Example:
	bsdtagconv 'gbk,ascii:utf-8,ascii;big5,ascii:utf-8,ascii' -i utf-8,ascii:zhtw:zhtw_words:utf-8,ascii --auto blah.mp3
	argv[1] is ';' joined utf-8 ended conversion, for id3v1 decoding.
	bsdtagconv will choose the best result.

Dependencies:
	bsdconv-5.0
	buganini/taglib

Bugs: (actually this should be done in taglib)
	strip() write file without save()
	--strip with --notest: tags are all removed, but not written
