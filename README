Notice:
	This program is assuming you are using UTF-8 environment.

Example:
	bsdtagconv 'gbk,ascii;big5,ascii' -i zhtw:zhtw_words --auto -r big5,ascii blah.mp3
	argv[1] is ';' joined from-conversion, for decoding tags which use
	legacy charset/encoding (eg. id3v1).
	bsdtagconv will choose the best result.

Charset/Encoding Guessing:
	By default, libbsdconv uses a rough builtin appeareance frequency table,
	you can use `find musicdir > bsdconv utf-8,ascii:score_train:utf-8,ascii > /dev/null`
	to build you own table, it's saved in /tmp/bsdconv.score
	(or path stored in BSDCONV_SCORE environment variable)

	For a traditional chinese user, you may want to train it again with zhcn:
	`find musicdir > bsdconv utf-8,ascii:zhcn:score_train:utf-8,ascii > /dev/null`
	as the fact that many files with traditional chinese filename contain simplified chinese tags.

	Alternatively, if your directory structure could be referenced as metadata,
	with --guess-by-path, it detects encoding by matching with path string,
	you can use "-v zhcn" to train it as what previous paragraph does at runtime.

Dependencies:
	bsdconv-5.0
	audio/id3lib
	audio/taglib

TODO/BUGS:
	deal with non-text field
